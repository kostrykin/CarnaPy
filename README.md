CarnaPy
========

The aim of this package is to provide real-time 3D visualization in Python for specifically, but not limited to, biomedical data. The library is based on [Carna](https://github.com/kostrykin/Carna).

See [examples/kalinin2018.ipynb](examples/kalinin2018.ipynb) for an example.

## 1. Limitations

* Only 8bit and 16bit volume data are supported at the moment.
* DRR renderings are not exposed to Python yet.
* Build process is currently limited to Linux-based systems.

---
## 2. Dependencies

Using the library requires the following dependencies:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) ≥ 1.16
* EGL driver support
* OpenGL 3.3
* Python ≥ 3.7

The following dependencies must be satisfied for the build process:
* [Carna](https://github.com/kostrykin/Carna) ≥ 3.1
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) ≥ 3.0.5
* [libboost-iostreams](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html)
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
* EGL development files

In addition, the following dependencies are required to run the test suite:
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

---
## 3. Installation

The easiest way to install and use the library is to use one of the binary [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) packages:

```bash
conda install -c kostrykin carnapy
```

Conda packages are available for Python 3.7–3.9.

---
## 4. Build instructions

There is a build script for Ubuntu Linux which builds a wheel file:
```bash
sh linux_build.sh
```
Adaption to other distribution should be self-explanatory.

After building the wheel file, it can be installed using:
```bash
python -m pip install --force-reinstall $(find . -name 'CarnaPy*.whl')
```
